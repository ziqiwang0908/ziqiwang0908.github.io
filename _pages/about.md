I am Ziqi Wang, a Master's student in Computer Science at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/), expecting to graduate in January 2027. My research interests are in AI Agents, especially in their planning and reasoning capabilities.

I am currently a Research Assistant in [Prof. Yongfeng Zhang’s lab](https://yongfeng.me/), focusing on Agentic RAG. My work investigates how different combinations of data representations and queries impact retriever performance.

I am also a Teaching Assistant for [Prof. Wes Cowan's](https://sites.rutgers.edu/wes-cowan/) courses on [Deep Learning](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-462-introduction-to-deep-learning) and [Introduction to AI](https://sites.rutgers.edu/wes-cowan/cs-520-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence/). In this role, I help students understand the foundational mathematical models of neural networks and guide them in building models of increasing complexity.

I am actively seeking new research opportunities and am eager to collaborate with other wonderful labs.
